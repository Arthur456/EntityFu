[An intro to entity component systems.](http://www.raywenderlich.com/24878/introduction-to-component-based-architecture-in-games)

Basically:
- An entity is simply just an integer ID.
- Components are pure data representing aspects of an entity.
- Systems are where the code goes to operate on components.
